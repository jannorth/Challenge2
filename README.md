# <Challenge2>

## This professional porfolio was created in order to showcase HTML & CSS skills and past, current, and a place for future professional development.

The motivation for this project was to fulfill the need of displaying professional progress and development in an organized way that helps the developer grow and make connections. It solves the problem of having work scattered about and puts it all in one organized place that will help the developer reflect and share their work with others. Now, I have a better understanding of what to include in a professional profile, why it's important and how to organize it.
